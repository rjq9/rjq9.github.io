    With love for and in wretched parody of <span id="jb">Jon Bois</span>.<br />

<p class="narrator">(The podcast begins. The duration reads 4 hours, 33 minutes, and 53 seconds.)
</p>
<p class="rob"> 
    <span class="ROB">ROB:</span> Welcome back folks! It's been a long time.
</p>
<p class="narrator">(His voice is entirely at ease. In light of his recent divorce, this is largely an act.)</p>
<p class="rob" title="I based this off of Graham Reid's 2009 piece on the Rolling Stones. (https://www.elsewhere.co.nz/absoluteelsewhere/2409/the-rolling-stones-in-the-seventies-the-decade-of-decadence/)">
    So, today I have a story for you. It's a story that started before I was born. The year was 1972. My parents were both seventeen at Atilla High School in Michigan.
    They hadn't met yet. 
    And, that year, my parents both picked up a copy of the Rolling Stones' new album: Exile on Main Str---.

    <span class="NINE">NINE:</span> Wait. Why are we listening to a podcast?
</p>
<p class="ten"><span class="TEN">TEN:</span> Juice. </p>
<p class="juice"><span class="JUICE">JUICE:</span> what do you have against podcasts </p>
<p class="ten">Don't put on hour long podcasts because you think it's funny.</p>
<p class="juice">i genuinely like podcasts</p>
<p class="ten">.</p>
<p class="ten">Of course you do.</p>
<p class="juice">like</p>
<p class="juice">say you want to hear about liz phair</p>
<p class="juice">well, the podcaster says, you can</p>
<p class="juice">but first i will spend an hour on my life story</p>
<p class="juice">and include pointless digressions that don't relate to anything</p>
<p class="ten">Sure. But why for four hours?</p>
<p class="juice">why not</p>
<p class="nine">Wait. Who's Liz Phair?</p>
<p class="juice" title="Specifically, 1967. This is just from Phair's Wikipedia article, sorry. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Phair)">
    rock star from new haven <br />
    born in the late 60s <br />
    made a few albums too
</p>
<p class="ten">Is this podcast about her?</p>
<p class="juice">.</p>
<p class="juice">you'll see</p>
<p class="nine">.</p>
<p class="ten">.</p>
<p class="juice">.</p>
<p class="juice">i'm putting the podcast back on</p>
<!--<p class="nine">.</p>
<p class="nine">I'm putting the podcast back on.</p>-->
<p class="rob">---eet. My parents loved that album. They still do. They played it constantly when I was a kid.
</p>
<p class="rob" title="Ibid.">
    Now, Exile on Main Street was a little patched together, a bit rough in spots. Mick Jagger doesn't like it anymore. 
    Still, growing up I loved that album, though I admit it was an acquired taste. It combined rock'n'roll, blues, country, into one cohesive whole.</p>
<p class="ten">Juice, I'm heading off. Nine, you know you can leave too.</p>
<p class="juice">cmon this is just getting good</p>
<p class="rob">Flash forward to 1993. 
    I'm fifteen, and the radio is playing, and all of a sudden I hear this: </p>
<p class="narrator">(A brief sample from Liz Phair's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgL3L7b5qM4">Explain It to Me</a>" plays.)</p>
<p class="rob" title="Some of the following claims are based on Marc Fagel's 2020 blog post. (https://www.jitterywhiteguymusic.com/2020/08/liz-phair-stones-exile-on-guyville.html)">Now, I didn't realize it at the time, but that song was a response. 
    That's Explain It to Me. It's from Liz Phair's album Exile in Guyville. I didn't understand it then. But, looking back, it's hard to understate its importance. It was a response to Rolling Stones', a response to rock, and a response to a culture that would come to embrace and twist her words.</p>
<p class="juice">.</p>
<p class="juice">nine</p>
<p class="juice">want to make a bet</p>
<p class="nine">Sure.</p>
<p class="juice">twenty dollars that rob is about to bring in someone to interview</p>
<p class="nine">.</p>
<p class="nine">I don't have twenty dollars. You don't either.</p>
<p class="juice">then you have to listen to this at half the speed</p>
<p class="nine">Don't give me that. Let's just keep listening.</p>
<p class="rob">But, to explain that, we have to meet Marsha.</p>
<p class="marsha"><span class="MARSHA">MARSHA:</span> Hey!</p>
<p class="nine">Very clever. You've listened to this one before, haven't you?</p>
<p class="juice">.</p>
<p class="juice">maybe</p>
<p class="rob">Marsha is a professor of law at Stephenson University in Arizona. She's written three books on the indie rock scene of the 90s.
    She is also, as she explains, a very big fan of Liz Phair.</p>
<p class="marsha">I am.</p>
<p class="rob">So, Marsha, tell me. When did you first realize you were a fan?</p>
<p class="marsha">Well, (hah,) I guess it goes back to 1991, actually. I had met this guy, Mark, who listened to a lot of indie rock.
And this was back in Chicago, you know. So he comes up to me one day, and shows me these tapes with "Girly Sound" on them.
</p>
<p class="rob">Wait. Those were her original recordings, right?</p>
<p class="marsha">Right.</p>
<p class="rob">That's crazy. So you were one of her original followers.</p>
<p class="marsha">I guess---</p>
<p class="juice">ok so now rob talks about his life for a bit so i'm going to skip ahead</p>
<p class="narrator">(He skips ahead 15 minutes and 12 seconds.)</p>
<p class="marsha">---And I remember thinking, at the time, that she was going to be famous.</p>
<p class="rob">That's---</p>
<p class="juice">i'm going to skip ahead again</p>
<p class="juice">sorry but i've listened to all his podcasts and i get tired of his voice</p>
<p class="nine">Fair enough.</p>
<p class="rob">---So tell me, Marsha. What happened after Phair released her album?</p>
<p class="marsha">Well, at the time, I remember that people started saying,
    this is a big deal, because I don't know any women who are willing to talk like that. And it was pretty crazy, then,
    because she based her album off of a group that was really for guys, you know?
</p>
<p class="narrator">(An interlude. The interview abruptly stops.)</p>
<p class="rob">That wasn't an accident. Phair deliberately chose a band with strong ties to masculinity.
    In an interview with the New York Times, she said:
</p>
<p class="narrator">(A recording of Liz Phair plays.)</p>
<p class="liz" title="Jessica Bennett's 2018 interview. (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/arts/music/liz-phair-exile-in-guyville-reissue-interview.html)"><span class="LIZ">LIZ:</span>...Using the Rolling Stone's Exile on Main Street was sort of like using their avatar.
I thought that was the quintessential guy rock band, you know?</p>
<p class="rob">And, like the Stones, her performances in E. As Marsha explains in her new book, Rock Solid:</p>
<p class="marsha" title="Based off of Lauren Sandler's opinion piece. And Aimee Levitt's. (https://www.huffpost.com/entry/opinion-sandler-phair-exile-feminism_n_5aea1b98e4b00f70f0eebd25, https://chicagoreader.com/blogs/how-the-reader-reviewed-exile-in-guyville-when-it-first-came-out/)">
    ... Phair's songs were in a bizzare no-man's-land. They weren't anthems, nor were they ballads. They were strong and they were vulnerable. They were complicated.
</p>
<p class="rob">Still, her unforgiving lyrics resonated. Her songs topped the charts that year. But that came at a cost. Again, Marsha:</p>
<p class="marsha">Phair's songs got her to the cover of Rolling Stone. For most, that would be a sign of success.</p>
