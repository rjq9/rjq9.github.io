<p>Although most of your time here at Codex will be at the city of James, that is not to say that there isn't beauty outside of the city! <br> </p>
<h1>Bonehenge</h1>
<p class = "alt">Nearby the city is a gigantic pyramid of bones with intricate carvings. Surrounding it is several gates also made of bones. <br>
This site, the aptly named "Bonehenge," is of unknown origin, but many archaeologists believe it is from the ancient city of Ghahnna, which was a prosperous city of cannibalistic
spiders until the man-eating spiders conquered the world. </p>
